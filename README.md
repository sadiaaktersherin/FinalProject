# Second-hand Marketplace - Starter
This is a minimal starter scaffold for the assignment you provided.

## What is included
- Minimal React app structure (no build artifacts)
- Firebase service file (placeholder config, set env vars)
- Example components: Navbar, Banner, CategoryCard, ProductCard, BookingModal
- Example pages: Home, CategoryPage, Login, Signup, Dashboard placeholder
- React Router setup with a PrivateRoute example
- React Query usage example (products by category)

## How to run
1. Unzip and `cd` into the folder.
2. `npm install`
3. Create a Firebase project and add environment variables in `.env` (see src/services/firebase.js)
4. `npm start`

## Notes
This is a starter scaffold to help you implement the full assignment. It contains the structure and example code for the features requested (booking modal, product cards, seller verification flag, etc.). You'll need to complete Firestore write/read logic and Stripe on the backend for payments.
